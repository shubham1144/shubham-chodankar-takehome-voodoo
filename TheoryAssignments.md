# Theory Assignments
You should complete these only after you have completed the practical assignments.

The business goal of the game database is to provide an internal service to get data for all apps from all app stores.  
Many other applications at Voodoo will use consume this API.

#### Question 1:
We are planning to put this project in production. According to you, what are the missing pieces to make this project production ready? 
Please elaborate an action plan.

#### Question 2:
Let's pretend our data team is now delivering new files every day into the S3 bucket, and our service needs to ingest those files
every day through the populate API. Could you describe a suitable solution to automate this? Feel free to propose architectural changes.

#### Question 3:
Both the current database schema and the files dropped in the S3 bucket are not optimal.
Can you find ways to improve them?
